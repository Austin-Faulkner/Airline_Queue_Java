# Simulating A Southwest Airlines Passenger Queue at Boarding Time

This program simulates an Airline's queueing model. There are separate lines A and B. Initially, line C is a "pre-board" line. In stage 1, lines A and B are queued into line C at a rate selected by the user/kiosk manager--for example, 10 queue into C from A and 20 queue into C from B. Line C is then boarded. Then the remainder of line A and B is queued into line C in stage 2. Line C is then boarded again, making for a two stage boarding process.
