# Airline_Queue_Java

Simulates a Southwest Airline's queue where two initial lines in round 1 are supposed to be lines A and B. Initially, line C is a "pre-board" line. In round 1, lines A and B are queued into line C. Line C is boarded. Then the remainder of line A and B is queued into line C in round 2. Line C is then boarded, making for two stages of boarding.
